## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### Question: "Tell me about your most complex data engineering project"

**Answer Framework**:

1. **Problem**: "Banking needed to reduce 20% customer churn costing millions in acquisition"

2. **Approach**: "Built end-to-end pipeline: ETL → feature engineering → ML → dashboard"

3. **Challenges**:

   - Class imbalance (80-20 split) → solved with upsampling
   - Missing transaction data → handled with default values
   - Performance optimization → batch processing design

4. **Results**:

   - 86% accuracy, identified 1,200 at-risk customers
   - $900K savings opportunity
   - Real-time prediction capability

5. **Learnings**: "Importance of business-driven metrics vs just accuracy"

### Question: "How would you scale this to production?"

**Your Answer** (you have this ready!):

```
Phase 1 (Week 1-2):
✅ Add comprehensive testing (pytest)
✅ Implement security (env variables, encryption)
✅ Set up monitoring (Prometheus metrics)
✅ Create CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Phase 2 (Week 3-4):
✅ Deploy to AWS/Azure
✅ Implement Airflow for orchestration
✅ Build REST API for predictions
✅ Add data drift detection

Phase 3 (Month 2+):
✅ Real-time processing (Kafka streams)
✅ A/B testing framework
✅ Advanced monitoring (Grafana)
✅ Auto-scaling infrastructure
```

### Question: "What would you improve if you had more time?"

**Great Answer**:

"Three main areas:

1. **Testing**: Increase coverage from 60% to 90%+ with integration tests
2. **Scalability**: Move from pandas to Spark for 1M+ customer processing
3. **Features**: Add time-series analysis for seasonal churn patterns

But the foundation is solid—the architecture supports all these enhancements without refactoring."
